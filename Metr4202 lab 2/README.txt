This toolbox bundle contains toolboxes and Matlab script written for the University of Queensland’s Metr4202 ‘Lab 2 Assignment’ (Please see task sheet entitled        for more information).  The toolboxes supplied will require adaptation for your own systems, as per information found in the ‘runFull.m’ script.  Also, please download RADOCCToolbox from this link (only download Automatic Camera Calibration Toolbox):http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/akas9185/AutoCalib/ Also, please ensure Kinect sensor is correctly calibrated by following the instructions found in this link:http://www.mathworks.com.au/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30242-kinect-matlab The kinect_mex toolbox (included in ‘toolbox’ folder) is to suit OpenNI1.x software and has been adjusted and tested on a MacBook Air running OSX 10.8.5 and Matlab 2011a.  All other toolboxes required are included in this package.  Code is in a stable state, returning reasonable data however requires further work to become completely reliable.  Calibration (including colour detect) is adequate, while localization and coin detection could be further improved to increase the accuracy of the system (current camera can only be accurately located using a Caltag approximately 700mm from lens, for X and Z positioning only).  Code completed by students Scott Hansen and Joshua Collins, acknowledgements go to the kind hearted souls whose ‘blood sweat and tears’ made all of this possible, by developing the toolboxes we have used in our submission.
